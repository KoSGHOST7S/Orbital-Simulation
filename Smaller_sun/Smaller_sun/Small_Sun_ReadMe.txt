This is a much smaller version of the Runar Thorvaldsen version for those who have a slow internet connection and/or a low performance computer.

If your computer can handle Virtual Textures and you have about 140 Mb of space available then it is highly recommended that you download the full version.

Please read the "Original_Sun_Readme.txt" for copyright and info on the large version



INSTALLATION:
--------------------------------------------------
Drop the folder "small_th_sun" into
/CelestiaResources/extras/addons/
(If the Addons folder does not exist, create it).



NOTE ABOUT A PORTRAIT OF OR SUN:
--------------------------------------------------
This is a semi-real G-star model. It is based on
real imagery.

Important: if you have a modest computer setup,
you should delete the "th_suncover.png" file
from the  textures/hires/ folder; else, the haze
it provides will not be drawn.



SIGHTS TO SEE:
--------------------------------------------------
To see the flares, make sure cloud rendering
is ON.



CREDITS
--------------------------------------------------
Thanks to Frank Gregorio for permission to use
his own Sun Solar System Catalog data for this
add-on.

Thanks also to Cham, for his contribution to
the solar flare animation; basically, he wrote
it, and i messed it up afterwards.
